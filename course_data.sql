Probability theory gives us the basic foundation to model our beliefs about the different possible states of the world, and to update these beliefs as new evidence is obtained. These beliefs can be combined with individual preferences to help guide our actions, and even in selecting which observations to make. While probability theory has existed since the 17th century, our ability to use it effectively on large problems involving many inter-related variables is fairly recent, and is due largely to the development of a framework known as Probabilistic Graphical Models (PGMs). This framework, which spans methods such as Bayesian networks and Markov random fields, uses ideas from discrete data structures in computer science to efficiently encode and manipulate probability distributions over high-dimensional spaces, often involving hundreds or even many thousands of variables. These methods have been used in an enormous range of application domains, which include: web search, medical and fault diagnosis, image understanding, reconstruction of biological networks, speech recognition, natural language processing, decoding of messages sent over a noisy communication channel, robot navigation, and many more. The PGM framework provides an essential tool for anyone who wants to learn how to reason coherently from limited and noisy observations.</p>\nIn this class, you will learn the basics of the PGM representation and how to construct them, using both human knowledge and machine learning techniques; you will also learn algorithms for using a PGM to reach conclusions about the world from limited and noisy evidence, and for making good decisions under uncertainty.

Rather, the course will emphasize those aspects of the theory that people really use in practice. Finite automata, regular expressions, and context-free grammars are ideas that have stood the test of time. They are essential tools for compilers. But more importantly, they are used in many systems that require input that is less general than a full programming language yet more complex than "push this button."<br><br>The concepts of undecidable problems and intractable problems serve a different purpose. Undecidable problems are those for which no computer solution can ever exist, while intractable problems are those for which there is strong evidence that, although they can be solved by a computer, they cannot be solved sufficiently fast that the solution is truly useful in practice. Understanding this theory, and in particular being able to prove that a problem you are facing belongs to one of these classes, allows you to justify taking another approach â€” simplifying the problem or writing code to approximate the solution, for example.<br><br>During the course, I''m going to prove a number of things. The purpose of these proofs is not to torture you or confuse you. Neither are the proofs there because I doubt you would believe me were I merely to state some well-known fact. Rather, understanding how these proofs, especially inductive proofs, work, lets you think more clearly about your own work. I do not advocate proofs that programs are correct, but whenever you attempt something a bit complex, it is good to have in mind the inductive proofs that would be needed to guarantee that what you are doing really works in all cases.', 'https://www.coursera.org/course/automata', 'video', '2013-01-11', 42, 'https://s3.amazonaws.com/coursera/topics/automata/large-icon.png', 'Computer Science: Theory,', 'Stanford University'),

This growth over the past decade is partly attributable to the growth of neuroscience itself and to the challenging philosophical and moral questions it inherently raises. A 2012 Royal Society report observes that â€œ(a)n increasingly mechanistic understanding of the brain raises a host of ethical, legal, and social implications. This has laid the foundation for the emergent field of Neuroethics, which examines ethical issues governing the conceptual and practical developments of neuroscience. Irrespective of their validity, even the claims that modern neuroscience entails the re-examination of complex and sensitive topics like free will, consciousness, identity, and responsibility raises significant ethical issues. As such, neuroethics asks questions that extend beyond the usual umbrella of biomedical ethics.â€ This course will, therefore, consider the new knowledge and ways of learning about the brain from scientific and ethico-legal and social standpoints.

Finally, we shall try to\ndetermine what it means to be modern today, and whether it makes sense to go\nbeyond the modern to the postmodern.\n\n\n\n<p><i>The Modern and the Postmodern</i> traces the intertwining of the\nidea of modernity with the idea of art or culture from the late 18th\ncentury until the present. Beginning with the Enlightenment, Western cultures\nhave invested heavily in the notion that the world can be made more of a home\nfor human beings through the development of culture (and technology).\nThroughout this period there has also developed a strong, sophisticated\ncounter-movement that sees the Enlightenment effort as a disaster â€“ destructive\nof both art and of the world.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The\nWestern idea of modernity is linked to but not the same as the idea of\nmodernism. We will examine both in this class and then consider postmodernism\nin relation both to the philosophical idea of modernity and to the aesthetic\nconsiderations of modernism.</p>\n\n\n\nThis course covers a lot of ground,\nhistorically, conceptually and aesthetically. There is much to read, and very\ndifferent kinds of reading: from philosophy to novels, from theory to poetry.\nNot all students will like all the reading, but if you digest it all, you\nshould have a clearer sense of the cultural history of our present. \n\n\n\n<br><br>Students\nshould develop a historical, literary and philosophical understanding of some\nof the key themes of modernity and modernism in the West. They should learn to\nread classic and contemporary texts for their arguments, beauty and pertinence.\nThey should see why these texts are â€œgood to think with,â€ and, it is hoped,\nthey will develop an appetite for further study in the areas covered by the\ncourse.\n<br>', 'https://www.coursera.org/course/modernpostmodern', 'video', '2013-01-11', 98, 'https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/ae/40ab4d371617977d0c8b273d63e014/The-Bar-at-the-Folies-Bergeres-by-Edouard-Manet.jpg', 'Humanities ,', 'Wesleyan University'),

(179, 'Introduction to Music Production', 'Learn about the music production processâ€”including recording, editing, and mixingâ€”and the tools available to you to create contemporary music on your computer. ', 'With the recent introduction of high-quality-low-cost software and hardware, the tools of music production are now available to the masses. Albums are made in bedrooms as well as studios. On the surface this is liberating. Anyone can make an album for the low cost of a couple pieces of gear and a software package. But, if you dig deeper, you will find that it is not so easy. Producing music requires knowledge, <b></b>dedication, and creativity.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>Knowledge is where this course comes in. No matter what kind of music you are making, there is a large set of tools that you will need to use.&nbsp; Each lesson of this course will demonstrate a different set of music production tools, loosely following along the music production process of recording, editing, and mixing. <br><br>We will start with some background on the nature of sound and how we perceive it. We will then examine the components necessary to record audio into a computer, so that you understand the devices that sound must travel through in a music production process. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>Once recorded, sound must be organized along a timeline, a process known as editing. It allows us to give the impression of perfect performances and create many of the sounds we hear in contemporary music. The contemporary editing tool is the Digital Audio Workstation (DAW),&nbsp; a piece of software that stores and organizes all the assets of a musical project. We will focus on the editing tools that are essential in contemporary music production and that all DAWs provide. <br><br>After editing, sounds must be combined or mixed together, so we look to the mixing boardâ€”a very creative place if you know how to use it. We will explore the basic functionality of both hardware and software mixing boards, including volume, pan, mute, solo, busses, inserts, sends, and submixes. The mixing process, however, includes more tools than the mixing board provides on its own. Sound must also be processed, modified from its recorded state to fit the context of the music. We will look at compression, equalization, and delay, and examine the many audio effects that are offshoots of these devices and how they are used in a musical context.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>We will then explore the synthesizer, a major tool within the production of contemporary music. Yes, great music can and will be created without the synthesizer, but learning how a synthesizer works will give you a language to describe sound. Music is a collaborative art form, so there is nothing more powerful than effective communication. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>In the end, the music production process relies on your creativity. Creativity is a product of the mind and will stay there, unexpressed, until the right tools are used in the right way to share it with the world. If you have an idea in your head, it will take numerous steps, each with an important tool, to reach your audience. You bring the dedication and creativity, and this course will bring you the knowledge to make that happen.<br>', 'https://www.coursera.org/course/musicproduction', 'video', '2013-01-11', 42, 'https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/01/ddf467a93b09155ddb4f07b07204b1/production-large.jpg', 'Music, Film, and Audio,', 'Berklee College of Music'),
